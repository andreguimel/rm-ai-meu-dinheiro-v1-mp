# Task 8 Implementation Summary: Trial Expiration Handling and Upgrade Flow

## Overview

Task 8 has been successfully implemented with comprehensive trial expiration handling and upgrade flow functionality. The implementation provides a smooth user experience for trial users approaching expiration and those whose trials have expired.

## Implemented Components

### 1. TrialExpirationModal Component ✅

**Location:** `src/components/TrialExpirationModal.tsx`

**Features:**

- Shows different content for expiring vs expired trials
- Displays days remaining for expiring trials
- Lists premium features to encourage upgrade
- Provides upgrade button that triggers checkout flow
- Offers "Continue with limited access" option for expired trials
- Responsive design with proper icons and styling

**Key Props:**

- `isExpired`: Boolean to determine modal content
- `daysRemaining`: Number of days left in trial
- `onUpgrade`: Callback to trigger checkout process
- `onOpenChange`: Callback to handle modal open/close state

### 2. Enhanced SubscriptionGuard Component ✅

**Location:** `src/components/SubscriptionGuard.tsx`

**Enhanced Features:**

- **Hierarchical Access Control:** Admin > Paid > Trial > Basic > None
- **Trial Expiration Detection:** Automatically detects expired and expiring trials
- **Modal Management:** Shows expiration modal at appropriate times
- **Session Management:** Prevents repeated modal displays in same session
- **Basic Access Fallback:** Provides read-only access for expired trial users
- **Smooth Upgrade Flow:** Integrates with checkout system

**Access Levels:**

1. **Admin:** Full access (highest priority)
2. **Paid Subscription:** Full access
3. **Active Trial:** Full access
4. **Basic Access:** Read-only access on specific pages for expired trial users
5. **No Access:** Redirect to profile page

### 3. BasicAccessProvider Context ✅

**Location:** `src/components/BasicAccessProvider.tsx`

**Features:**

- Provides context for basic access state throughout the app
- Exposes `isBasicAccess` boolean and `showUpgradePrompt` function
- Used by components to determine if user has limited access

### 4. BasicAccessBanner Component ✅

**Location:** `src/components/BasicAccessBanner.tsx`

**Features:**

- Shows informational banner for users with expired trials
- Explains limited access mode
- Provides upgrade button
- Only displays when user is in basic access mode

### 5. useBasicAccessControl Hook ✅

**Location:** `src/hooks/useBasicAccessControl.ts`

**Features:**

- Provides `checkAccess()` function to verify if actions are allowed
- Provides `wrapAction()` function to automatically block actions in basic mode
- Shows appropriate toast messages when actions are blocked
- Integrates with upgrade prompt system

**Fixed Issues:**

- ✅ Fixed JSX compilation error by using `React.createElement` instead of JSX syntax
- ✅ Added proper React import for TypeScript compatibility
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript error with toast action by simplifying to onClick handler
- ✅ Fixed duplicate import of `TrialStatusBanner` in Despesas.tsx

## Implementation Details

### Trial Expiration Logic

```typescript
// Detects expired trials
const isTrialExpired =
  hasTrialHistory &&
  !subscriptionData.trial_active &&
  !subscriptionData.has_paid_subscription;

// Detects trials expiring within 1 day
const isTrialExpiring =
  subscriptionData.trial_active &&
  (subscriptionData.trial_days_remaining ?? 0) <= 1 &&
  (subscriptionData.trial_days_remaining ?? 0) >= 0;
```

### Session Management

- Modal dismissal is tracked per session to prevent annoyance
- Users can manually trigger upgrade prompt from basic access banner
- Successful upgrade attempts reset dismissal state

### Basic Access Pages

The following pages provide read-only access for expired trial users:

- `/dashboard`
- `/receitas` (Income)
- `/despesas` (Expenses)
- `/transacoes` (Transactions)

### Action Wrapping Example

```typescript
const { wrapAction } = useBasicAccessControl();

const handleAddIncome = wrapAction(async (data) => {
  // This action will be blocked if user has basic access
  await createIncome(data);
}, "adicionar receita");
```

## Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 3.1 ✅

**"WHEN o período de teste expira THEN o sistema SHALL bloquear o acesso às funcionalidades premium"**

- ✅ Implemented in SubscriptionGuard hierarchical access control
- ✅ Premium actions are blocked via useBasicAccessControl hook
- ✅ Users are redirected to profile page if trying to access non-basic pages

### Requirement 3.2 ✅

**"WHEN o usuário tenta acessar funcionalidades premium após expiração THEN o sistema SHALL exibir um modal de assinatura"**

- ✅ TrialExpirationModal automatically shows for expired trials
- ✅ Basic access banner provides upgrade button
- ✅ Blocked actions show toast with upgrade option

### Requirement 3.3 ✅

**"WHEN o período de teste expira THEN o sistema SHALL manter acesso apenas às funcionalidades básicas de visualização"**

- ✅ BasicAccessProvider enables read-only mode
- ✅ Specific pages (dashboard, receitas, despesas, transacoes) allow viewing
- ✅ All modification actions are blocked via useBasicAccessControl

### Requirement 3.4 ✅

**"WHEN o usuário assina um plano após expiração THEN o sistema SHALL restaurar imediatamente o acesso completo"**

- ✅ Upgrade flow triggers createCheckout() function
- ✅ Subscription verification automatically updates access level
- ✅ Modal dismissal state is reset after upgrade attempts

## Testing

### Created Test Files

1. **`src/components/__tests__/TrialExpirationFlow.test.tsx`** - Comprehensive flow testing
2. **`src/hooks/__tests__/useBasicAccessControl.test.ts`** - Hook functionality testing

### Test Coverage

- ✅ Trial expiration modal display logic
- ✅ Basic access mode functionality
- ✅ Action blocking and wrapping
- ✅ Upgrade flow integration
- ✅ Edge cases and error handling

## User Experience Flow

### For Expiring Trials (≤1 day remaining)

1. User sees modal with days remaining
2. Modal shows premium features list
3. User can upgrade immediately or dismiss
4. If dismissed, modal won't show again this session
5. User can still trigger upgrade from basic access banner

### For Expired Trials

1. User sees expired trial modal
2. Modal explains expiration and shows upgrade option
3. User can upgrade or continue with limited access
4. If continuing, user gets read-only access to basic pages
5. All modification attempts show upgrade prompts

### For Successful Upgrades

1. User clicks upgrade button
2. Checkout process opens in new window
3. After successful payment, subscription verification updates access
4. User immediately regains full access

## Performance Considerations

- Modal state is managed efficiently to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Session dismissal tracking prevents modal spam
- Access checks are optimized with proper memoization
- Basic access mode minimizes API calls for blocked actions

## Security Considerations

- All access control is enforced at the component level
- Backend verification ensures data integrity
- Fallback to "no access" on errors for security
- Admin users bypass all trial restrictions

## Future Enhancements

- Could add analytics tracking for trial conversion rates
- Could implement different trial lengths for different user types
- Could add more granular basic access permissions
- Could implement trial extension capabilities

## Conclusion

Task 8 has been fully implemented with robust trial expiration handling, smooth upgrade flows, and comprehensive basic access functionality. The implementation meets all requirements and provides an excellent user experience for trial users.
