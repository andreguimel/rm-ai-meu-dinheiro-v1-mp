# Task 3 Implementation Summary: Enhanced check-mercadopago-subscription Edge Function

## ✅ Task Requirements Completed

### 1. Integrate trial status checking with subscription verification

- **✅ IMPLEMENTED**: Added RPC call to `get_user_access_status(user.id)` function
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED**: Function now retrieves comprehensive trial and subscription status before processing MercadoPago data
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED**: Trial status is considered alongside paid subscription status in all response scenarios

### 2. Add trial_active and trial_days_remaining to response

- **✅ IMPLEMENTED**: All response objects now include:
  - `trial_active: boolean` - Whether user has an active trial
  - `trial_days_remaining: number|null` - Days remaining in trial period
  - `trial_start: string|null` - Trial start timestamp
  - `trial_end: string|null` - Trial end timestamp

### 3. Implement access_level calculation (none/trial/premium)

- **✅ IMPLEMENTED**: Added `access_level` field to all responses with values:
  - `"premium"` - User has paid subscription
  - `"trial"` - User has active trial but no paid subscription
  - `"none"` - User has neither paid subscription nor active trial
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED**: Logic prioritizes paid subscription over trial when both exist

### 4. Update caching logic to include trial data

- **✅ IMPLEMENTED**: Cache now stores complete response including trial fields
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED**: Cached data includes all new trial-related fields
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED**: Cache TTL remains consistent with existing subscription caching strategy

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Database Integration

- Uses `get_user_access_status(user_id)` RPC function from previous task
- Retrieves comprehensive status including trial and subscription data
- Handles cases where no subscriber record exists

### Response Format Enhancement

All response scenarios now include:

```typescript
{
  // Existing fields
  message: string,
  subscribed: boolean,
  subscription_tier: string|null,

  // New trial fields
  trial_start: string|null,
  trial_end: string|null,
  trial_active: boolean,
  trial_days_remaining: number|null,

  // New access control fields
  access_level: "none"|"trial"|"premium",
  effective_subscription: boolean,
  has_paid_subscription: boolean,

  // Existing payment fields...
}
```

### Access Level Logic

1. **Premium**: `hasValidPayment = true` (paid subscription with approved payment)
2. **Trial**: `accessStatus.trial_active = true` AND no paid subscription
3. **None**: No paid subscription AND no active trial

### Caching Strategy

- Cache key remains the same: `subscription:${userId}`
- Cache includes all trial data for consistent responses
- TTL uses existing `CACHE_TTL.SUBSCRIPTION_STATUS` (5 minutes)

## 🎯 Requirements Mapping

| Requirement                            | Implementation                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 4.1 - Trial status verification        | ✅ RPC call to `get_user_access_status`              |
| 4.2 - Access level hierarchy           | ✅ Premium > Trial > None logic                      |
| 6.1 - Integration with existing checks | ✅ Trial data included in all responses              |
| 6.2 - Consistent access control        | ✅ `effective_subscription` field for unified access |

## 🧪 Testing Considerations

The enhanced function maintains backward compatibility while adding new fields:

- Existing clients will continue to work with `subscribed` field
- New clients can use `effective_subscription` for trial-aware access control
- `access_level` provides clear hierarchy for UI components

## 📝 Next Steps

This task is complete. The function now:

1. ✅ Integrates trial status with subscription verification
2. ✅ Returns trial data in all responses
3. ✅ Calculates proper access levels
4. ✅ Caches trial data appropriately

Ready for frontend integration in subsequent tasks.
