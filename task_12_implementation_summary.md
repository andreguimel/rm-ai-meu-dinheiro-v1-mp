# Task 12 Implementation Summary: Trial Analytics and Monitoring

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive trial analytics and monitoring functionality for the 7-day trial system. This includes logging, database queries, error monitoring, and admin dashboard components.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Database Schema and Functions (`supabase/migrations/20250109_trial_analytics.sql`)

#### New Tables:

- **`trial_events`**: Stores all trial-related events with structured data

  - Supports event types: trial_created, trial_accessed, trial_expired, trial_converted, trial_error
  - Includes user_id, event_data (JSONB), and timestamps
  - Proper indexing for performance

- **`trial_analytics_summary`**: Daily aggregated analytics data
  - Tracks counts for each event type per day
  - Automatically updated via triggers
  - Enables fast dashboard queries

#### Database Functions:

- **`log_trial_event()`**: Logs events and updates daily summaries atomically
- **`get_trial_analytics()`**: Retrieves analytics data for date ranges with conversion rates
- **`get_trial_conversion_funnel()`**: Provides funnel analysis (created → accessed → converted)
- **`get_user_trial_journey()`**: Shows chronological event history for specific users

#### Security:

- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all analytics tables
- Admin-only access policies for viewing analytics data
- Proper function permissions for authenticated users

### 2. Backend Analytics Logging

#### Enhanced Edge Functions:

- **`start-trial/index.ts`**: Added analytics logging for trial creation and errors
- **`log-trial-analytics/index.ts`**: New dedicated function for frontend analytics logging

#### Logging Events:

- Trial creation success/failure
- Trial access attempts
- Trial expiration detection
- Conversion events (trial → paid subscription)
- Error tracking with detailed context

### 3. Frontend Analytics Integration

#### Hooks:

- **`useTrialAnalytics`**: Client-side analytics logging with convenience methods

  - `logTrialCreated()`, `logTrialAccessed()`, `logTrialExpired()`, etc.
  - Handles authentication and error states gracefully
  - Non-blocking analytics (failures don't affect user experience)

- **`useTrialAnalyticsData`**: Admin data fetching for analytics dashboards
  - `getTrialAnalytics()`: Historical data with conversion rates
  - `getTrialConversionFunnel()`: Funnel analysis
  - `getUserTrialJourney()`: Individual user event tracking

#### Enhanced useSubscription Hook:

- Automatic trial access logging when trials are active
- Trial expiration event detection and logging
- Error analytics for trial-related failures
- Non-intrusive logging that doesn't impact performance

### 4. Admin Dashboard Components

#### `TrialAnalyticsDashboard.tsx`:

- **KPI Cards**: Total trials, conversion rates, conversions, errors
- **Timeline Charts**: Daily trial activity with line charts
- **Conversion Funnel**: Visual funnel analysis with percentages
- **Distribution Charts**: Pie charts showing trial status distribution
- **Date Range Filtering**: 7, 30, 90-day views
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

#### `TrialErrorMonitor.tsx`:

- **Real-time Error Monitoring**: Last 24 hours of trial errors
- **Error Categorization**: Severity levels (low/medium/high)
- **Error Summary**: Grouped by error type with counts and affected users
- **Auto-refresh**: Optional 30-second refresh for monitoring
- **Detailed Error Logs**: Individual error details with context
- **Time-based Filtering**: Recent errors (1 hour) vs. all errors (24 hours)

### 5. Comprehensive Testing

#### Unit Tests (`useTrialAnalytics.test.ts`):

- Analytics logging functionality
- Error handling for network failures
- Session management
- Convenience method testing
- Data fetching operations

#### Integration Tests (`trial-analytics.test.ts`):

- Database function testing
- Event logging verification
- Analytics data retrieval
- Conversion rate calculations
- User journey tracking
- Row Level Security validation

## Key Features

### 1. Event Tracking

- **Trial Creation**: User registration, automatic trial setup
- **Trial Usage**: Dashboard access, feature usage during trial
- **Trial Expiration**: Automatic detection when trials expire
- **Conversion**: Tracking when users upgrade to paid plans
- **Errors**: Comprehensive error logging with context

### 2. Analytics Insights

- **Conversion Funnel**: Created → Accessed → Converted rates
- **Daily Trends**: Historical data showing trial performance over time
- **Error Monitoring**: Real-time error tracking with severity classification
- **User Journeys**: Individual user event timelines for support

### 3. Performance Optimizations

- **Aggregated Summaries**: Daily rollups for fast dashboard queries
- **Indexed Tables**: Proper database indexing for analytics queries
- **Non-blocking Logging**: Analytics failures don't impact user experience
- **Caching**: Frontend caching for analytics data

### 4. Security and Privacy

- **Admin-only Access**: Analytics data restricted to admin users
- **Data Anonymization**: Sensitive data properly handled
- **RLS Policies**: Database-level security enforcement
- **Audit Trail**: Complete event history for compliance

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Analytics Logging:

```typescript
const { logTrialAccessed, logTrialConverted } = useTrialAnalytics();

// Log trial access
await logTrialAccessed({
  trial_days_remaining: 5,
  access_level: "trial",
  feature_accessed: "dashboard",
});

// Log conversion
await logTrialConverted({
  subscription_tier: "Premium",
  conversion_source: "trial_banner",
});
```

### Admin Analytics Queries:

```typescript
const { getTrialAnalytics, getTrialConversionFunnel } = useTrialAnalyticsData();

// Get 30-day analytics
const analytics = await getTrialAnalytics("2024-01-01", "2024-01-31");

// Get conversion funnel
const funnel = await getTrialConversionFunnel();
```

## Database Queries for Manual Analysis

### Daily Trial Summary:

```sql
SELECT * FROM get_trial_analytics('2024-01-01', '2024-01-31');
```

### Conversion Funnel:

```sql
SELECT * FROM get_trial_conversion_funnel('2024-01-01', '2024-01-31');
```

### User Journey:

```sql
SELECT * FROM get_user_trial_journey('user-uuid-here');
```

### Error Analysis:

```sql
SELECT
  event_data->>'error_type' as error_type,
  COUNT(*) as occurrences,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as affected_users
FROM trial_events
WHERE event_type = 'trial_error'
  AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY event_data->>'error_type'
ORDER BY occurrences DESC;
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor:

1. **Conversion Rate**: Should be > 15% for healthy trials
2. **Access Rate**: % of created trials that are actually used
3. **Error Rate**: Should be < 5% of total trial events
4. **Trial Creation Failures**: Critical errors that prevent trial setup

### Recommended Alerts:

- Conversion rate drops below 10%
- Error rate exceeds 10%
- Trial creation failures > 5 per hour
- No trial conversions in 24 hours
